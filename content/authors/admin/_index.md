Applications are open for 'Scientific Communication Through Social Media (COVID Superheroes)' and 'Community Building (Leadership Team)' internships. 

(A) COVID Superheroes: Applicants for the COVID Superheroes internship are required to be fluent in the English language and have an interest in scientific or health communication. The selected candidates will get an opportunity to go through a multi-step training program which will provide them with the skill sets required to convert scientific publications into short-form social media messages. Upon successful completion, the interns will be certified as COVID Superheroes and get promoted as community partners. More details on COVID Superheroes is available at: https://www.covidsuperheroes.org

(B) Community Building: Applicants for the community building internship will join the leadership team in scaling up the One Health platform and taking forward ideas across interdisciplinary landscapes. Applicants are required to have an interest in leadership, networking, and organizational strategization. The selected candidates will work closely with the leadership to continue building an efficient One Health community. 

Both the internships are remote, part-time (4-10 hours a week), voluntary, and for a 6-month duration. Learning, mentorship, advancement, and leadership opportunities are available for the right person in due course. This is an equal opportunity platform, and applications are encouraged from socially disadvantaged and underrepresented sections of society.
